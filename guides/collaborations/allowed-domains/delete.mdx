title: "Remove a previously allowed domain for collaboration"
---
Deleting a domain from the list of allowed collaboration domains will remove the
ability for collaborations to be created between your enterprise and users in
that domain.

To remove a domain from the allowed list, supply the ID of the list entry to
the delete request. This ID is returned when [allowing a new domain][create]
or [listing the allowed domains in the enterprise][list];
