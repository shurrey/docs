To use the **Box AI API** you will need to create a **Box Platform App**.
A Box App is an application that can be used for making API calls. When
using the Box AI API you can choose to either set up your own Box App or use
our preconfigured one. The key benefit of setting up your own Box App
is that you won't need to go through login every hour, but it does require a few
extra steps to set up.

## Select a Box App to use

<Grid columns='3'>
  <Choose option='ai.app_type' value='use_ours' color='green'>
    # Use our Box App

    If you don't have access to Box AI in your Box instance, you can still
    experiment with the Box AI API by using our preconfigured Box App.
  </Choose>

  <Choose option='ai.app_type' value='create_new' color='blue'>
    # Create new Box App

    We can set up a Box App for you right here from the documentation. With a
    few clicks you will be ready to go!
  </Choose>

  <Choose option='ai.app_type' value='use_existing' color='red'>
    # Use existing Box App

    If you've already created a Box App before that you want to use, then we
    can use the credentials for that application.
  </Choose>
</Grid>

<Choice option='ai.app_type' value='create_new,clicked' color='blue'>
  # Create a Box App

  To use your own **Box App** you will need to create a
  new Box App in the **Box Developer Console**. Click the button below and we
  will set it up for you. At the end you will have a **Client ID** and
  **Client Secret**.

  <Trigger option="ai.app_type" value="clicked">
    <AppButton
      id='ai'
      name='Box AI Ask'
      scopes='root_readwrite,ai.readwrite'
      can_act_as_user
      authentication_type='auth_code_grant'
      redirect_url='http://localhost:3000/callback'
      cors_origins=''>
      Create an app
    </AppButton>
  </Trigger>

  <Observe option="ai.app_type" value="clicked">
    We will use these credentials to authenticate the Box CLI in the next
    step.
  </Observe>
</Choice>

<Choice option='ai.app_type' value='use_existing' color='red'>
  # Use existing Box App

  If you have already created a Box App before you can use that as well. We
  require a few settings to be set for this to work.

  1. Go to the [Developer Console][devconsole]
  2. Select your application
  3. Go to the applicationâ€™s **Configuration** section
  4. Make sure your application uses **Standard OAuth 2.0** as the authentication method
  5. Scroll down to the **OAuth 2.0 redirect URI** configuration and set the **Redirect URI** to the value `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
  6. Scroll down to the **Application Scopes** section to select your desired [permissions][scopes]. **Your application must have at least one or more** **of the following scopes:** read and write all files and folders in Box,
  Manage AI.
  7. At the top of the page click the button to **Save Changes**

  Next, copy the values for the Client ID and Client Secret into these 2 fields.

  <Store id='ai_credentials.client_id' placeholder='zECq2EkYBjZ...' pattern='\w{32}'>
    Client ID
  </Store>

  <Store id='ai_credentials.client_secret' placeholder='913td9hr6jo...' pattern='\w{32}'>
    Client Secret
  </Store>

  We will use these credentials to authenticate the Box API in the next
  step.
</Choice>

<Choice option='ai.app_type' value='create_new,use_existing,clicked' color='none'>

<Message danger>
  # Security notice

  Your API credentials are now stored in the browser cache. We highly
  recommend clearing out this storage by clicking the **Reset** button later in
  this guide.
