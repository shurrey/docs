title: "Pagination"
---
The Box API supports two ways to paginate collections. The most common way to
paginate is through offset-based pagination which is often used where the list
of items is of a fixed, predetermined length.

In some cases an API endpoint supports marker-based pagination, either as an
alternative to offset-based pagination or as a full replacement. Marker-based
pagination is often used in cases where the length of the total set of items is
either changing frequently, or where the total length might not be known
upfront.
